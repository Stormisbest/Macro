# AFK Macro Recorder

A simple Python-based GUI application to **record**, **save**, and **play back** keystroke macros with timestamps.  
Useful for automating repetitive key presses or AFK tasks in games and other applications.

---

## Features

- Record keystrokes and durations of each key press  
- Playback recorded macros once or on repeat  
- Automatically saves recorded macros with timestamps to `logs.txt`  
- Colorful and user-friendly Tkinter GUI  
- Works as a Python script (`.py`) or standalone Windows executable (`.exe`). Just won't save to logs due to needing to send the whole folder not just the exe.

- `macro.py` — Python source code  
- `macro.exe` — Standalone Windows executable built with PyInstaller (Can be found in dist folder)
